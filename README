Smith: Super Mega Intuitive Todolist Helper

Smith is more than a todolist manager, smith is designed not only to show you
that you have unresolved tasks, but also to actively help you to resolve them.

Smith let's you link your tasks with scripts to be more reactive when dealing
with tasks, that way you can automatically launch your media player to see the
next cat video on your watchlist, open your mail client well configured to
answer that mail from your boss and more...

Edition commands use the EDITOR environnement variable.
