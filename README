Smith: Super Mega Intuitive Todolist Helper

Smith is more than a todolist manager, smith is designed not only to show you
that you have unresolved tasks, but also to actively help you to resolve them.

Smith let's you link your tasks with scripts to be more reactive when dealing
with tasks, that way you can automatically launch your media player to see the
next cat video on your watchlist, open your mail client well configured to
answer that mail from your boss and more...

Edition commands use the EDITOR environnement variable.

How to make the magic happen
============================

« I want to study SICP using MIT's OpenCourseWare videos while keeping track
  of my progress. Can Smith help me? »

It is exactly what it is for!

Let's start a new task:

    $ smith -t

    Editing [14a506183f8] New task:
    Title [New task]: SICP

    # We let it at 0, as we haven't seen any video
    Progress [0]:

    # There are 20 videos
    Limit [1]: 20

    # While at it, we will make a generic script for opencourseware ?
    Script []: ocw_videos

    # A generic script will need the url of the course in argument
    # (Of course you would put the real url here)
    Script_args []: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/..../video-lectures/

    # No comment here
    Comment []:


The task is created, we can see it:

    $ smith -s last

    [0:14a506183f8] SICP              [                        ] 0/20

Let's edit the script now to really add the action:

    $ smith -a last

    (Our favorite editor is launched here)

    #!/bin/sh
    #
    # Open Course Ware
    # This is a script for the SMITH todolist management tool
    # It is called with the following arguments:
    #      the current progress of the task
    #      the limit set for the task
    #      the argument field of the task

    PLAYER="vlc"
    LISTURL="$3"

    # This builds the url of the video page associated with the lesson
    URL="http://ocw.mit.edu$(curl -s "$LISTURL"                        |\
                             tr '"' '\n'                               |\
                             grep "${URL#http://ocw.mit.edu}"          |\
                             grep -v "rss.xml"                         |\
                             uniq                                      |\
                             sed -n "$1p")"

    #This is the youtube url of the video
    YTURL="$(wget -O- -q "$URL"    |\
             tr "'" "\n"           |\
             grep "youtube.com/v/")"

    exec "$PLAYER" "$YTURL"

Everything is now in place, it is time to try it.

    $ smith -d last

    (VLC launches here on the video)

If you play the player exits normally (at the end of the video or if closed
peacefully by you), it will return no error. The progress is then updated.

    $ smith -s last

    [0:14a506183f8] SICP              [#                       ] 1/20

This also means that if there were an error the progress would'nt be updated.

And you can now reuse this script with another course without having to set
everything up again, you will just have to set the same script name and the
corresponding extra argument.

If you made a mistake, you can always update the progress manually:

    $ smith -s -u last

    [0:14a506183f8] SICP              [##                      ] 2/20

    $ smith -s -U 2 last

    [0:14a506183f8] SICP              [####                    ] 4/20

    $ smith -s -U -2 last

    [0:14a506183f8] SICP              [##                      ] 2/20

And if you are done with this task:

    $ smith -r last

    $ smith -s 14a506183f8

    No task with ID '14a506183f8': ignoring it

That's it !
